          <h3 style="padding: 0 40px;">
            
            I’m a dedicated and adaptable Software Engineer with 2 years of experience specializing in backend engineering at American Express. My journey into technology has been anything but conventional. As a career changer, I transitioned into this field under challenging personal circumstances, but my determination and passion for innovation have enabled me to flourish in this new role.
            
          </h3>
          <h3 style="padding: 0 40px;">
            Since joining American Express as a graduate in 2022, I’ve grown significantly, earning a permanent position as a Junior Engineer on my team. My work focuses on developing robust backend systems, and I’m constantly eager to learn and integrate new technologies to drive our projects forward.
          </h3>
          <h3 style="padding: 0 40px;">
            In recognition of my journey, I was honored with the SheCanCode PowerUp Award for 2024 as the Best Career Changer—a testament to my take-charge attitude and commitment to my new career path. Beyond my technical work, I’ve also led volunteering initiatives within American Express, reflecting my belief in giving back and fostering a supportive community.
          </h3>
          <h3 style="padding: 0 40px;">
            I’m excited to continue growing in my role, tackling new challenges, and contributing to the ever-evolving tech landscape.
